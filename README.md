# Dark-Light
Dark Light is dark fantasy 2D metroidvania indie development Project that takes heavily inspiration from Hollow Knight and the Soulsbourne Series. Development of the game started in early 2019 and has been continued at a slow pace due to University work. Dark Light is a personal project that was started during a Cert-IV in Interactive and Digital Games major assessment to build a Arcade Game. Once the Cert-IV was over, the skeleton of a game slowly became a passion project in which it's development would be carried across the next few years to date. In It's current form, there are a lot of bug that need to be fixed and a lot of code set to be rewritten due to it's outdated and inefficient style. Once past issues have been corrected, development will continue at a steady pace.

## Theme & Setting
Dark Light is set within the ruins of a once proud but fallen kingdom. The founder ruled with Darkness and shunned away the light. Our hero/main character wakes up under a tree and is set to discover and wander around this fallen kingdom as they attempt to find the truth about how the kingdom fell and how they will unknowingly play a part in the revival of the kingdom.
