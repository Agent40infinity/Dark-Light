# Dark-Light
Dark Light is a metroidvania in the works which takes heavy inspiration from the Dark Souls trilogy and Hollow Knight. Development of the game started in early 2019 and has been continued at a lowered pace throughout 2020. Dark Light is a personal project that was started during a Cert-IV in Interactive and Digital Games and has become more or less a passion project. In It's current form, there are a lot of bugs that need to be fixed and code that needs to be updated for efficiency reasons and for simplistics sake.

## Theme and Setting
Dark Light is set within the ruins of a once proud but fallen kingdom. Darkness was ruled by the founder while the light was shunned away.
